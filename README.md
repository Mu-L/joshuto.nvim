# A Neovim Plugin for [Joshuto](https://github.com/kamiyaa/joshuto)

Disclaimer: I straight-up copied most of the code in this plugin from [lazygit.nvim](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim) because I just wanted something working asap. The only reason I didn't fork lazygit.nvim but made a new repository instead was because this is plugin for a completely different purpose (not for using Lazygit). I want to give credits to the author of lazygit.nvim for writing awesome code and thank him for using the MIT licence.

(Documentation work-in-progress)

### Usage
```
:Joshuto
```

or 
```
lua require'joshuto'.joshuto()
```

or to open files in tabs
```
lua require'joshuto'.joshuto({ edit_in_tab = true })
```
